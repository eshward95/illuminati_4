# Illuminati_4

To implement a webpage for predicting placement results for students seeking jobs.

## Inspiration
The performance in the education sector in India is a turning point in the lives of all students. As this academic performance is influenced by many factors, it is essential to develop predictive data mining model for studentsâ€™ performance so as to identify the slow learners and study the influence of the dominant factors on their academic performance. It is an important consideration to analyse various trends since all the system are now computer based information system so data availability, modification an updation are a common process now. As a direct outcome of this project more efficient student prediction tools can be developed , improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.
## Our Solution
In this study , we collected the students' data based on their performance in quantitative,logical,communication skills. Applying data mining techniques on this , discoversuseful information that can be used in formative evaluation to assist educators establish a pedagogical basis for taking important decisions.




## Workflow
1. The user visiting our webpage will be asked to login.
